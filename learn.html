      There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of
      different industries. Being computer illiterate just won’t cut it any more
      in the world of work. And ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at
      the moment.And everyone from Bill Gates to Obama is encouraging young
      people to give it a go. But what exactly does learning to code entail? And
      why is it so important? Read on to find out.

      <b>Coding can lead to software development jobs</b>
      <p>Coding is the fundamental
        skill for jobs such as software development. There is currently a shortage
        of software developers worldwide, so learning to code can be an easy route
        into an open field of work. However, this isn’t the only way coding can
        open up job opportunities.</p>

    <b>It open up other job opportunities,Coding can make your job application stand out.</b>
    <p>
      For smaller start-ups, hiring someone solely to take care of coding and
      web design may not be the most economically viable choice. Having coding
      as a string to your bow can be key to finding jobs related to the field
      (like content creation, marketing, PR and more).
      <p>
        Even if you’re applying
      for a position which has no direct relevancy to coding, it’s still well
      known as a useful skill. Thus, by having any knowledge of it, you’ll
      automatically give yourself a foot up on the competition. On top of it
      being a generally worthwhile skill in most jobs, it also shows that you’re
      hardworking, dynamic, and a self-starter.

    <b>Coding literacy can help you understand other aspects of tech.It could lead to freelance work</b>
    <p>
      Knowledge of coding (or, as some call it, coding literacy) can help in other ways, too. 
      It can mean you are quicker to learn other aspects or tech, plus mean you are more digitally fluent. 
      In today’s ever more digital job market, this can only be of benefit.
      <P>If you’re wanting to go freelance, or have the ability to work while traveling, coding may be a great way 
      to get into this. As coding is a highly valued skill at the moment, many companies are willing to outsource 
      the work. 
      This means skilled coders have the ability to create their own schedule (and charge a nice rate for it at the 
      same time).
